        Reading is a frequent pastime of mineâ€”especially when I have found a
        book that satisfies my prefrences. Often, the books I read belong in
        genres of fanatasy and thriller with a mild but evident touch of comedy.
        The series and books I have read are listed below;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Throne of Glass series</li>
        <li>The Cruel Prince Series (ongoing)</li>
        <li>The Six of Crows duology</li>
        <li>Heartless</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These types of noodles are an indo-chinese dish and my go-to. The
        flavourful meal, which I highly enjoy, can be spicy, although it depends
        on how you make it.

        Spring is where flowers bloom, spring is also my prefered season. This
        is due to the warm and rainy tempreture during this time as well as the
        spring or march break.
